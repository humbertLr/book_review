# 5 The search of Truth
## What is true?
questions:
- What is it for a set of beliefs to be true?
- How will we know when our beliefs are true?
- What if the "obvious" is not always so?
epistemology, the theory of knowledge
some of the reasons why the notion of a belief being true is ==not as straightforward as it seems==
1). "What is it for an assertion or a belief to be true?"
if and only if it corresponds to the facts
that turns out not to help us at all
1. there are true statements that do not (or need not ) correspond to any facts, eg: 75x3=225.
2. How do we know what we believe as a matter of common sense is in fact justified and not just **a set of plausible falsehoods** that have been handed down uncritically from person to person, generation to generation?
3. Must all statements in science be confirmed by **experience**? And what about religious truths? Is there a kind of truth that depends on faith and is very different from scientific truth?
## Two kinds of truth
1). true because of the facts
2). true because of reasoninng
- necessary truths
### Empirical Truth
true because of experience, only when we have actually looked at the world
**contingent truth** and contingent falsehood 
### Necessary Truth
true because of reasoning
prior to experience, a priori
