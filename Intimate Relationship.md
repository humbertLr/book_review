# The Building Blocks of Relationships
People suffer when they are deprived of close contact with others, and at the core of our social nature is our need for intimate relationships.
## The nature and importance of intimacy
### The Nature of Intimacy
intimate relationships differ from more casual associations in at least seven specific wasys:
**knowledge**

extensive personal, often confidental, knowledge about each other
**interdependence**
**caring, trust, responsiveness**
**mutuality**
people recognize close connection adn think of themselves as "us" 
**commitment**
intimate partners expect their partnerships to continue indefinitely, and they invest the time, effort, adn resources that are needed to realize that goal

there's no one kind of intimate relationship
## The Need to Belong
>Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary(1995)
>we need frequent, pleasant interactions with intimate partners in lasting, caring relationship if we're to function normally.
