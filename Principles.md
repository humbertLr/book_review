# Introduction
Think for yourself to decide:
1. what you want
2. what is true
3. what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2
...and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you.

## MY PRINCIPLES AND HOW I LEARNED THEM
making a lot of **mistakes** and spending a lot of time **reflecting** on them
The Key to Success
knowing how to both **strive** for a lot and **fail well**
- fail well: experience painful failures that provide learnings ==without failing badly enough to get knocked out of the game==

Make believability-weighted decisions
look at things through the eyes of others as well as my own
learning how to weigh people's inputs so that I have my decision making, increased my chances of being right and was thrilling

Operate by principles
write down the decision-making criteria

Systemize your decision making
develop your own principles and write them down
