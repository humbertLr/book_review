2. **Transmission of information**, which assists in transforming the various, unrelated parts of a complex system and brings them together as a whole

the second pair of concepts
1. Humans and animals and their physiology
2. Machines and their mechanics

# Warren McCulloch
# Gregory Bateson
1. **Schismogenesis**: positive feedback loop that allows for the increasing destruction of relationships
	- Complementary schismogenesis
	- Symmetrical schismogenesis
2. **Double bind**
	- the patterns of interaction between people who must interact incompatibly with each other simultaneously
3. **Levels of learning**
	- Learning 0:
