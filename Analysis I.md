# Chapter 1 Introduction
## 1.1 What is Analysis?
objects: numbers, sequences, series, limits, functions, definite integrals, derivatives...
focused more on the **underlying theory** for these objects
questions:
1). What is a real number? Is there a largest real number?
2). How do you take the limit of a squence of real numbers?
3). What is a function?
## 1.2 Why Do Analysis?
One can get into trouble if one applies rules without knowing where they came from and what the limits of their applicablity are.
Example 1.2.1: Diviskon by zero. The cancellation law $ac=bc$ => $a=b$ does not work when $c=0$ .
Example 1.2.2: Divergent series.
